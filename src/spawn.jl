  Optional 1-based thread ID to start the task on.

  If task migration is disabled, then the task will execute on this thread during its entire lifespan.
  If set to `nothing` (default), then the starting thread is the same as the thread launching the task.

  !!! warning
      If task migration is disabled, and no start thread ID has been set, the task will run similarly to an `@async`-spawned
      task and execution will never occur in parallel between the spawning task and the spawned task.

  Allow tasks to migrate between Julia threads.

  This makes it reliable to use `Threads.threadid()` as an index from this task, for example enabling the pattern

  ```julia
  const results = [Int[] for i in 1:Threads.nthreads()]

  # ...
  # Spawn a bunch of tasks.
  # ...
  # Execute code like the following from these tasks:
  push!(results[Threads.threadid()], rand())
  ```

  Disabling this can be useful when e.g. C libraries rely on functions to be executed in the same thread in which
  some library-defined context has been created, as can be the case for graphics API such as Vulkan or OpenGL.
